# Project-PICIT

readme for our projrct!
Problem Definition
With the introduction of digital cameras and smart phones into our lives, we are never satisfied with one single photograph.  Every event on our lives of documented in a series of nearly-identical photos, which are shared on social media. Yet, there is always the one person who is dissatisfied.  We are here to satisfy everyone!
Over the course of this project, we wish to develop an algorithm which will allow the generation of the perfect photograph, which will include each person's favorite moment.
For example, if three people are photographed in three consecutive pictures at a birthday party, each photograph will disappoint one of them.  In the first picture, Amir is blinking.  In the second, the birthday girl is looking away, and in the third, a balloon is blocking Keren's face.  By integrating the three photographs, we aim to create the perfect picture, incorporating the best shot of each of them.
