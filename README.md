# Project-PICIT

Welcome to see our demo video in the "PICIT_video.mp4" file, enjoy!!!

With the introduction of digital cameras and smart phones into our lives, we are never satisfied with one single photograph.  Every event on our lives of documented in a series of nearly-identical photos, which are shared on social media. Yet, there is always the one person who is dissatisfied.  We are here to satisfy everyone!

We create an interactive application for combining parts of a set of photographs into a single composite picture. Our framework uses graph-cut optimization, to choose good seams within the constituent images so that they can be combined as seamlessly as possible.

Our algorithm allows the generation of the perfect photograph, which will include each person's favorite moment, in a user-friendly app.
